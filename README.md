# Dognation: Password Authentication

*Welcome to Dognation!*

*Dognation is a collaborative site for dogwalkers to share pictures of their buddies. People can sign in and post pictures of the dogs they walk and share them with everyone!*

*We were recently hired to complete a missing feature for the app! It currently doesn’t have any configuration to authenticate users. In this project, **we’re focusing on implementing the logic for user authentication**. Specifically, we will be using `express-session`, Passport's `passport-local`, and `bcrypt.js` to handle user registration, login, session management, and logout functionalities.*

*Please note that this description pertains solely to the logical implementation of the authentication features. We are working with boilerplate code that we will modify and enhance to complete this functionality. Let’s get started!*
